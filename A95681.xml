         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Iſrael of God,</hi> &amp;c. But for as much as the enemies of divine truth are adverſaries to thoſe who continue in the ſame, it is no wonder that they fear not, both to reſiſt the ſpirit by whom it was inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to accuſe the work of contrariety and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Though the Scripture have no reall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties indeed in its ſelf, (for the Spirit of God, by <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.</note> whom thoſe holy men that writ it were led, being not <note place="margin">Chryſ. in Gen. hom. 1.</note> contrary to himſelf, did ſo govern the matter, that it ſhould wholly agree in all parts) yet ſome apparent contrarieties there are in it, which cauſe ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to the <hi>Reader;</hi> yet the whole body of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is not therefore to be accuſed of obſcurity, as though the will of <hi>God</hi> could not thence be certainly known, concerning things which appertain to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Nothing</hi> is ſearched out there, which is not to be found eaſily in ſome other place, nor is there any oppoſition in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> witneſſe <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>de Geneſ.

               <hi>nor ſpeak, that the Scriptures can be adverſe to themſelves, but if any Scripture ſeem to be ſo, and hath a colour as though it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict ſome other Scripture, I will rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that I underſtand not the things there ſpoken, being certainly perſwaded, that no part of Scripture can be oppoſite to any other part thereof,</hi> &amp;c. This is that I undertake to prove in this Reconciliatory Bible, wherein are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled above Two Thouſand places of the Sacred Scripture oppoſite in appearance, in a plain order, by the Canonical books of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> (ſhort collections of each Book, and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologicall numbers being ſet down before them) and the truth of the divine word is proved to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, to the honour and love whereof, all that doubt of the conſent of the ſame, are modeſtly invited. Some man perhaps will object that ſome things are borrowed by me from others; which I deny not; for in compiling this Synopſis, I thought it more ſafe and diſcreet, to follow the ſteps of the moſt approved <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters,</hi> then without the authority of <hi>famous men,</hi> in this moſt corrupt age, which is full of Error and Hereſie, to invert any thing of my own brain, and to publiſh it to the world. And I hope that the <hi>Curteous Reader,</hi> and the equall cenſurer, are not ignorant, that in the ſtudy of Divinity, nothing can be ſaid now, that was not ſaid before. And it is moſt profitable, that many Books ſhould be <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> 110. Aug. tom. 3 de Trin. lib. 1. c. 3.</note> made by many men, of the ſame things, in a divers ſtyle, but not in a different <hi>faith.</hi> And he ſhall finde that I have compendiouſly gathered together in this <hi>Concordance,</hi> that which the greater works of
<pb facs="tcp:119711:4"/> learned men contain more at large; ſo that here he may, as it were at a ſingle view, comprehend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let thoſe famous men have the praiſe, who have ſet forth large handfuls in this harveſt. I would not that any one ſhould derogate from their Orthodox labours, but let them have it rather then my ſelfe. Yet I doubt not, but that he who was, and is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall in their large and learned Commentaries, will ſupply me with his grace, and be preſent to theſe gleanings.</p>
            <p>If any one condemn my brevity and rudeneſſe of my ſtyle, I ſought to be brief, but not obſcure; becauſe brevity is profitable, and is accounted moſt acceptable alwayes; by this there is nothing loſt in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. My religious mind bad me ſtop this little body with ſolid meat, not with lofty and windy words (if there be any thing found in it that is not as it ſhould be, I crave pardon; what is not ſpoken religiouſly enough, let it paſſe as not ſpoken) far be it from me that I ſhould arrogate to my ſelf, as though I had exactly written without error; for I am not he of whom it may be ſaid, He made it, in the perfect tenſe, <note place="margin">D. Mart. Luth. in praef.</note> but I ſtand in the laſt ranke, who ſcarſe dare ſay, I would have made it; yet in great matters it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to be willing. Wherefore I being much ſollicited by ſome like my ſelf, that is of the meaner ſort, and by the moſt pious deſire of my intimate friends, by this little Book of mine, firſt intended for private uſe; I would, nay I am obliged to do them good; but not them who ſuppoſe they better underſtand theſe things, <hi>For who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi>

                  <p>108. Lev. 1. 6. <hi>The ſons of Aaron ſhall pull off the skin of the burnt offering, and cut it into pieces.</hi> 2 Chron. 35. 11. <hi>The Levites pulled off their skins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the office of the Prieſts to pull off the skins of the burnt-offerings, but becauſe in the time of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſias,</hi> the celebration of the Paffeover was ſolemn, and many millions of ſacrifices were offered, therefore it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily granted to the <hi>Levites</hi> to pull off the skins.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God forbad that the King ſhould have many wives, leſt his heart ſhould forſake the true God, and run after ſtrange gods, as <hi>Solomons</hi> did, loving many ſtrange women, and fell into ſo great luſt by following them, that forſaking the true God, he ſet up many Idols of the Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>Kings muſt not for their pride heap up great quantity of ſilver and gold to the oppreſſion of their ſubjects; otherwiſe they had need of great riches to preſerve their Countries and their Kingly Majeſty.</p>

                     <hi>Moſes</hi> condemns ſuperſtitious obſervation of dayes, as if one day were more happy then an other.

                  <p> It is an abomination in the ſight of God, and a heathen ſuperſtition to conſult with Wiſards, &amp;c.

                  <p>The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> craftily ſaved their lives, laying down their high ſpirits, and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> made the <hi>Amorites</hi> tributaries, the other enemies of God and his people who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſtubborn in their wickedneſſe were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>168. Deut. 20. 19. <hi>When you beſiege a City, you ſhall not deſtroy the trees.</hi> 2 King. 3. 19. <hi>You ſhall fell euery good tree.</hi>

                  <p>Thoſe trees that bear fruit the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could feed on, were not to be cut down in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed land; but in the Country of the <hi>Moabites</hi> God would ſhew a peculiar example of his juſt anger for their ſins.</p>

                  <p>God would not ſuffer baſtards to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to publick offices for the diſgrace of their births, and the honour of Matrimony, leſt the Common-wealth ſhould grow contemptible by ſuch: but that excluſion is not to be taken for a puniſhment but an affliction which God in the next life will reward with more glory, if they be pious and penitent.</p>
                  <p>172. Deut. 23. 6. <hi>Thou ſhalt make no peace with the Ammonites and Moabites.</hi> Rom. 12. 18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi>

                  <p>The fugitive ſervant was not to be ſent back to his angry maſter who was ready to kill him. There was a difference amongſt the ſervants of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he that was to ſerve ſeaven years, if he ran away after he had ſerved ſix years, he was not to be ſent back to his Maſter, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were bond-ſervants all their lives.</p>

                  <p>A Raven indeed is an unclean creature, not by creation, but by divine ordination, and the forbidding men to eat his fleſh; but to touch the Raven alive, or to eat the meat he brought was not unclean to <hi>Elias,</hi> nor an abomination before God.</p>

The Apoſtle ſpeaks only of the morall law, not as it is in it ſelf, for ſo it is the perfect law of righteouſneſſe and brings life, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of us who are tranſgreſſors of the Law,

                     <hi>David</hi> commendeth the Law of God, and that there is great reward in the keeping of it. In which the goodneſſe of God is commended, who may of right require obedience from us, yet he freely gives a reward unto us, which he oweth not. Chriſt ſheweth, that we, and all that we have are due unto God; therefore we can aske nothing for a reward; and it is preſumption to think that we can deſerve any thing at Gods hands.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place is ſignified the ſenſe of Gods wrath and the effect thereof in Chriſt, who taking upon him our perſon, is made ſin for us; though he complained that he was forſaken as man, yet he was not forſaken as the Son of God, nor was the divine nature ſeparated from the hnmane nature, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported it. In the latter place, when Chriſt ſaith, I am not alone, he hath reſpect to the flight of the Apoſtles, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyeth himſelfe againſt it by the preſence of his Father.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place is meant naturall laughter, and rejoycing in proſperity, and the goods of Nature and Fortune, as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do; and this <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> condemns as folly. But in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is commended that joy only which proceeds from the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Politick wiſdome is indeed a ſingular gift of God; but if any man abuſeth it, and dependeth on his wiſdome it profits not, but is all vanity. Divine wiſdome which teacheth us to wait all events from God, and to pray to him for his direction in all, confers eternall life.</p>

                     <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> compares the oppreſſed with the oppreſſours, in that which happens in the world: for oppreſſours are rich, mighty men, they have their Abetters and their Clients.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet makes mention of what fooliſh men ſay; who thought both by their words and deeds, that God ſaw them not; whoſe perverſe judgement doth not hinder the truth which maintains that all things, be they never ſo ſecret, yea the thoughts of our hearts are open before God.</p>
                  <p>453. Ezek. 18. 4. <hi>The ſoul that ſins, that ſhall die.</hi> Rom. 5. 6. <hi>Chriſt died for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſentence is legall, and teacheth what muſt be done by the law divine or humane, legally. The laſt is Evangelicall, ſhewing that God for Chriſts ſake freely gives us his grace and ſalvation.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet underſtands the law that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and enlightens us. The Apoſtle, the law that condemns us; For there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 33</note> to thoſe that are juſtified in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <p>God will not the death of a ſinner by his antecedent will, but by his conſequent will or his juſtice; becauſe he juſtly puniſheth him who rejects the grace of God offered unto him. He hardens therefore permiſſively, not effectively.</p>

                  <p>God as our Father will not by the Goſpell, but as he is our judge and revenger, he will by the law, that a ſinner ſhall die.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God will not the death of him that repents, for his mercy is over all his works. A ſin unto death, is a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, and ſo it is called, becauſe it is iuſtly puniſhed with finall impenitency.</p>
                  <p>460. Ezek. 18. 26. <hi>When a righteous man turns away from his righteouſneſſe, and doth iniquity, he ſhall die in it.</hi> Rom. 8. 30. <hi>Whom he juſtified them he glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Righteous in the firſt place is not truly ſo but only in opinion, ſo Chriſt came not to call the juſt; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 13.</note> thoſe that are truly juſt, who are juſtified in Chriſt and ſhall be ſurely glorified. Or if the place of the Prophet be to be interpreted of him that is truly juſt, it is conditionall,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119711:81"/> and ſo proves nothing, and the contradiction is reconciled.</p>
                  <p>461. Ezek. 20. 25. <hi>I gave them alſo Statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they ſhould not live.</hi> Pſal. 19. 9. <hi>The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Precepts that are not good are either legall threatnings by which God menaces curſes to the wicked, or falſe doctrine, when God by his juſt judgement ſuffers thoſe that would not believe the truth, but go forward in iniquity, to believe lies.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet means ſpirituall circumciſion by faith in Chriſt; but the Apoſtle means nothing but corporall and legall circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which was that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtrove to be juſtified by. <note place="margin">Col. 2. 15.</note>

                  <p>612. Mat. 20. 29. <hi>As they departed from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo, Behold two blind men.</hi> Luk. 18. 35. <hi>As he came nigh to Iericho a certain blind man ſat by the way ſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Chriſt entred the City, the blind man firſt cryed out, and when he was not heard for the noyſe, he ſat in the way where Chriſt went out, and never left crying till Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and healed him. Chriſt did defer his cure, but did not wholly refuſe it; ſo he made proof of his faith, and of many others.</p>
                  <p>613. Mat. 21. 19. <hi>The fig tree was forthwith dryed.</hi> Mar. 11. 20. <hi>In the morning as they paſſed by, they ſaw the fig-tree dryed up from the root.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fig-tree indeed withered forthwith, but on the morning the day following the wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe was made manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>614. Mat. 22. 32. <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi> Rom. 14. 8. <hi>Whether we live or dye, we are the Lords.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt denyeth not ſimply, but comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and relatively from the hypotheſis of the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119711:110"/> 
                     <hi>Sadduces,</hi> that God was the God of the dead, for they ſuppoſed the dead ſhould never riſe again; <hi>Paul</hi> from another hypotheſis affirms the ſame, which depends on Chriſts reſurrection, on this wiſe, God is the God of the dead, becauſe the dead bodies ſhall riſe again.</p>
                  <p>615. Mat. 23. 9. <hi>Call no man your Father upon the earth.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>If you had ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors in Chriſt, yet have you not many Fathers, for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt will have us place our filial confidence in God only, not in men, though they love us with fatherly affection, and teach us the true Religion, and ſo are called Fathers, not by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by participation, that they are ſo. So <hi>Paul</hi> cals himſelf the Father of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of <hi>Timothy,</hi> by reaſon of the Goſpel, not primarily, but ſecondarily, becauſe he was an Inſtrument which God uſed to call and rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate them by the Goſpel; that he preached to them.</p>
                  <p>616. Mat. 23. 10. <hi>Be not called Maſters.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. <hi>You have many Maſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is our only ſpiritual <hi>Rabbi,</hi> Maſter and <note place="margin">Joh. 1.</note> Doctor; others that have theſe titles, are but ſervants to this great Maſter, becauſe they muſt teach no other but the Doctrine of Chriſt, <hi>For of his fulneſſe we have all received, he is the way, the truth, and the life,</hi> and it is enough to us that he ſaid it.</p>
                  <p>617. Mat. 23. 17. <hi>Yee Fools and blind. c.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of hell fire.</hi>

                  <p> Chriſt by his Office and his charity was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and to make them repent he called them fools and blind, but he forbids, that out of a carnal reproachful deſire, and greedineſſe of revenge, or pride, or mad anger any man ſhould detract from his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>618. Mat. 23. 37. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them. c.</hi> 27. <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem is called the holy City.</hi>

                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the City of Martyrs is there called the City of many Saints. It is called the holy City, for the moſt holy God by whom it was made choiſe of; or for the Meſſias who taught them the ſanctity of faith and life, and offered himſelf for us for a price of redemption; or for the Saints that were in it.</p>
                  <p>619. Mat. 25. 32. <hi>He ſhall ſeparate the Sheep from the Goats.</hi> Joh. 10. 16. <hi>And there ſhall be one ſheepfold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is concerning the future ſtate of the Church after the day of Judgement, that ſhall be otherwiſe then it is now, for then ſhall there be a ſeparation made. Hypocrites now paſſe for Sheep, then they ſhall be manifeſted to be Goats. The latter place is of the faithful <note place="margin">Eph. 2. 14. c. 5. 23. 1 Cor. 3. 11.</note> who ſhall be gathered into one ſheepfold, that is, the Church, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> under one ſhepherd.</p>
                  <p>620. Mat. 25. 34. <hi>Inherit the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4. <hi>He choſe us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:119711:111"/>
                  <p> Chriſt by the beginning and foundation of the world, underſtands eternity; the Apoſtle looks to the firſt Creation; for before the foundation of this world were laid, God choſe us in Chriſt to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>621. Mat. 25. 34. <hi>There is a Kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for us, before the foundation of the world.</hi> Joh. 14. 3. <hi>I goe, ſaith Chriſt, to prepare a place for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a place by Gods decree provided for us from eternity, according to predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not particular deſignation, which is done after Chriſts aſcenſion; but the Devil, Death and Hell, and Malediction did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to come thither, untill Chriſt had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe impediments, and by his death van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the Devil, Death, and Hell, blotted out our ſins, and by riſing again had reſtored life to us, by his Aſcenſion had opened heaven to us, and going thither before us confirmed it, that we ſhould follow him thither.</p>
                  <p>622. Mat. 26. 2. <hi>Ye know that after two days is the Feaſt of the Paſſeover. v.</hi> 6. <hi>Jeſus was in Bethany ſix days before the Paſſeover.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Evangeliſt began to ſpeak of what was done two dayes before the Paſſeover, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the matter higher, he relates ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things were done in <hi>Bethany</hi> ſix days before the Paſſeover, becauſe the Hiſtory of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytor required that. Therefore here is an Hyſteroſis.</p>
                  <p>623. Mat. 26. 7. <hi>A woman poured Oyntment on our Saviours head.</hi> Joh. 12. 3. <hi>Mary took a</hi>

                     <hi>pound of Oyntment of Spikenard very coſtly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted the feet of Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some hold that theſe are different Hiſtories, yet it might be that when a greater quantity of oyntment was poured forth, that his feet were anoynted alſo at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>624. Mat. 26. 8. <hi>The Diſciples ſaw it, and had indignation.</hi> Joh. 12. 4. <hi>Then ſaith one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Judas Iſcariot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Evangeliſts uſually aſcribe to many the fact of one, it their conſent went along with him. So the murmuring which <hi>Judas</hi> began, is imputed to the reſt who held their peace.</p>
                  <p>625. Mat. 26. 11. <hi>You have the poor alwayes with you, but me you have not alwayes. c.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>And loe I am with you alwayes even unto the end of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place Chriſt ſpeaks of his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral preſence and natural converſation with his Diſciples in the ſtate of humiliation, that he ſhould not be ſo alwayes with them. In the latter of the aſſiſtance by his Perſon, and his help that ſhould be effectual in their Apoſtolical duty, though it be difficult, yet Chriſt would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them by a ſingular vertue of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, dwelling in them. The accompliſhment of this promiſe was manifeſt in the Apoſtles, and in all the faithful by the operation of the Spirit in us, and ſhall be ſo to the end of the world.</p>
                  <p>626. Mat. 26. 26. <hi>This is my Body. c.</hi> 24. 23. <hi>If any man ſhall ſay unto you, Loe here is Chriſt, or there, believe him not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place Chriſt aſſerts his preſence in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119711:112"/> the ſacred Supper. In the latter he foretels that falſe Prophets ſhould come, and exhorts us that we ſhould beware of thoſe falſe Impoſtors, and ſhould not look for ſalvation in places, times, or perſons, contrary to Gods Word, but only in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
                  <p>627. Mat. 26. 26. <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Joh. 6. 63. <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt in the firſt place underſtands his body that was given to dye for us. In the latter, fleſh, but not his own in ſpecial, but in general, the natural uſe of any meat whatſoever. Not as the <hi>Capernaites</hi> dream, that they ſhould ſo eat his fleſh, who would eat him with their teeth, but not with their heart.</p>
                  <p>628. Mat. 26. 29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the Vine: He puts theſe words after the Inſtitution.</hi> Luk. 22. 18. <hi>He puts thoſe words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Inſtitution.</hi>

                  <p>629. Mat. 26. 29. <hi>I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of the Vine, untill that day when I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome.</hi> Act. 10. 41. <hi>We eat and drank with him after he roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſaid he would not drink with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in his mortal body; but after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, having put off the infirmity of his body, he after converſed with his Diſciples,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:119711:112"/> and eat and drank with them; he cals it new, becauſe he is made immortal of mortal, and the Devil and Death being deſtroyed, he had opened a ſpiritual Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>630. Mat. 26. 34. <hi>This night before the Cock crow thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> Mar. 14. 30. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cock crow twice, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi>

                     <hi>Matthew</hi> briefly and in general without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the circumſtances, but <hi>Mark</hi> relates the matter with more and more particular words.</p>
                  <p>631. Mat. 26. 52. <hi>All they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi> Luk. 22. 36. <hi>He that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment and buy one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſword is taken properly in the firſt place, for Chriſt will not that private men ſhould uſe the ſword for revenge, and to reſiſt evill, but ſhould overcome evill with goodneſſe: In the latter place, a ſword is taken metaphorically for the Word of God with which we muſt fight againſt Satan and our ſpiritual enemies, and <note place="margin">Rom. 12.</note> therefore we muſt be armed with it.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The confeſſion of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and the teſtimony he gave of Chriſts innocency was not with true repentance; but only ſorrow by the ſenſe of his ſin, which led him not to converſion, but to hand himſelf.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>At firſt going forth Chriſt himſelf carryed the Croſſe, and when he was grown too feeble in body, the ſouldiers compelled <hi>Simon</hi> whom they met on the way, to carry the Croſſe.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>675. Luk. 6. 26. <hi>Woe unto you when all men ſhall ſpeak well of you.</hi> Mat. 5. 16. (1 Pet. 2. 12.) <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works and glorifie your Father which is in heaven.</hi>

                  <p>Woe be to them, who do only ſo that they may pleaſe the world, and deſire the praiſe of men, flattering the wicked, and winking at their ſins that they may get favour. But not to them who like a light are an example of good works, and a godly life to others.</p>
                  <p>676. Luk. 6. 30. <hi>Give to every man that ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 4. <hi>Give to the godly, and help not a ſinner, hold back thy bread and give it not unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt will have that we ſhall doe good to our friends, and to our enemies, though they be wicked and ingrateful, by the example of our merciful heavenly Father, and if we give not to the perſon, yet give to his Nature as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119711:120"/> he is a man. A place of <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> may not be oppoſed to Canonical Scripture, who will have him that craves an alms to be humble, ſhutting out the wicked and obſtinate in malice, who abuſe the beneficence of good men.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt comforts the widow, who wept for the death of her onely ſon, becauſe her ſon ſhould ſuddenly live again. But Chriſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allows not moderate weeping for the death of our neighbour, only we muſt not mourn as thoſe that have no hope.</p>
                  <p>678. Luk. 8. 39. <hi>Return to thy houſe, and ſhew how great things God hath done unto thee. c.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>He commands the Leper that he ſhould tell no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt commanded him that was poſſeſſed with the Devil, to tell what benefits God had done for him; becauſe the time, the place and other circumſtances required that; but he ſent the leprous party who was cleanſed, to the Prieſt, that he might approve of the cure.</p>
                  <p>679. Luk. 10. 4. <hi>Salute no man by the way.</hi> Rom. 16. 16. <hi>Salute one the other with an holy kiſs, The Churches of Christ ſalute you.</hi> Phil. 4. 22. <hi>The Saints.</hi>

                  <p>Christ will have his Diſciples diligent in diſpatch of their Office, that they ſhould not hinder the courſe of their Miniſtery with long diſcourſes and ſalutations, but ſhould fulfil their journey in a ſhort time: ſuch a command

                  </p>
                  <p>The parts of Gods Word are the Law and the Goſpel; the Law promiſeth life eternal to them that doe it, the Goſpel to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

                  <p>Chriſt reprehends not <hi>Marthas</hi> care of her houſe, but for preſumption and falſe opinion, becauſe ſhe preferred the care of her houſe before the Word of God.</p>

                  <p>Chriſt would not have us forſake our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his wants and neceſſities, but rather (to help him) we ſhould ſell our poſſeſſions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare our conpaſſion ſo far as we are able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing injury to our family.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>God ſent not his Son to judge the world in his ſtate of humiliation; but he ſent him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem thoſe that were under the law: now in his ſtate of exaltation he doth and will judge the world. For all judgement and power is <note place="margin">Joh. 5. 19. Mat. 28.</note> given to him from the Father both in Heaven and in Earth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt did not outwardly baptize with his own hands, but by his Diſciples; yet it is called Chriſts Baptiſm, becauſe he appointed it, and conſecrated it by his Word, ſanctified it by his own Baptiſm, adorned it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it by annexing a promiſe to it, and becauſe with the outward Baptiſm by water,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:119711:125"/> he joyneth the baptiſm by fire, that is, he <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 11. Luk. 3. 17.</note> inwardly waſheth our hearts by the baptiſm of his Spirit and his own bloud, pardoning our ſins, and purging our corrupt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>707. Joh. 4. 13. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the water, that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Eccleſiaſticus 24. 21. <hi>They that eat me, ſhall yet hunger, and they who drink me, ſhall thirst yet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks concerning thirſt and deſire of a thing, which a man that hath it not, wiſheth for; <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> concerning a thing already acquired; and of wiſdome, whoſe memory is ſweeter then Honey, and the Inheritance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, better then Honey and the Honeys-combe, as <hi>Lyra</hi> ſpeaks on <hi>Eccleſiaſticus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>708. Joh. 4. 38. <hi>You have entred into others mens labours.</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 15. <hi>Let no man be a buſie-body in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens matters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place Chriſt ſpeaks of Apoſtles lawfully called, who under the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not drawn by curioſity, but being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely and immediately called, entred on the labours of the Prophets; in the latter an ill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is forbidden.</p>
                  <p>709. Joh. 3. 5. 19. <hi>The Son can doe nothing of himſelf. c.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>No man taketh away my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt as man can doe nothing of Gods works of himſelf, but from the Father, giving all honour and glory to the Father. So the <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> Apoſtle could doe all things through Chriſt: In the latter place he treats of the divine power,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:119711:126"/> that he had of laying down his life for his ſheep, <note place="margin">Joh. 10. 15.</note> and of taking it up again.</p>
                  <p>710. Joh. 5. 22. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement to the Son. c.</hi> 8. 15. <hi>I judge no man, ſaith Chriſt to the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Father judgeth by the Son, and worketh all things: for works external are common to the three Perſons: Chriſt judgeth no man with unrighteous Judgement, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did raſhly judge of him, according to their carnal affections, being led with hatred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                  <p>711. Joh. 5. 27. <hi>The Father hath given all power and judgement to the Son. c.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world, that he might judge the world, but that the world ſhould be ſaved by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place ſpeaks of the coming of Chriſt in glory, and of his Majeſty; or of the ſending of the Son to Judgement; the latter is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſts coming in humility, when he came not to judge the world, but that the world ſhould be ſaved by him.</p>
                  <p>712. Joh. 5. 31. <hi>If I bear witneſſe of my ſelf, my witneſse is not true. c.</hi> 8. 14. <hi>Though I bear record of my ſelf, yet my record is true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the former place Chriſt ſpeaks after the opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would ſay to him, thou beareſt witneſſe of thy ſelf, and no man that bears witneſſe of himſelf is worthy to be believed; and he urgeth them with it, that if he teſtified of himſelf, without the teſtimony of others, then they ſhould not believe him, but he had <hi>John</hi> for a witneſſe. c. 5. v. 33. the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:119711:126"/> Father. verſ. 32. 37. his works. verſ. 36. the Scripture. verſ. 39. By the latter he defends the authority of his own teſtimony, becauſe he knew for what he was ſent; and to whom he ſhould return, that is, to the Father, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not alone, but the Father was with <note place="margin">Verſ. 16.</note> him.</p>
                  <p>713. Joh. 5. 34. <hi>I receive not teſtimony from men. c.</hi> 15. 27. <hi>And ye alſo ſhall bear witneſſe, becauſe you have been with me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt in reſpect of himſelf wanteth no mans teſtimony, nor doth receive the teſtimony of men, or glory from them, chap. 5. 41. as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, chap. 5. 44. But when Chriſt chooſeth witneſſes of his Truth amongſt men, he doth it by reaſon of our infirmity, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <note place="margin">Joh. 20. 32. Act. 10. 43. 1 Joh. 1. 3.</note> we may have ſociety with him, and it may be for our ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>714. Joh. 5. 39. <hi>Search the Scriptures. c.</hi> 6. 45. <hi>They ſhall be all taught of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks firſt of the manner and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, but afterwards of the internal means, for God teacheth us by the Scripture, as an ordinary means, for he will have us to ſearch his will in and out of the Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he teacheth us by the Scriptures, as he doth bring to paſſe other things by ordinary means.</p>
                  <p>715. Joh. 5. 44. <hi>How can you believe, who receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that cometh from God only?</hi> chap. 12. 42. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Chief Rulers alſo many believed on him, but</hi>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:119711:127"/> 
                     <hi>becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſſe him, left they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The faith of the Rulers, if it had been true and lively in Chriſt, it would have ſhewed it ſelf by confeſſion and good works, and would have brought forth good fruit: it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but an Hiſtorical or temporary faith; for they loved the glory of man, more then the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>716. Joh. 6. 29. <hi>This is the work of God, that you believe.</hi> Rom. 3. 28. <hi>We are juſtified by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith is called the work of God, becauſe it is the effect and gift of God, and pleaſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. The work of faith, as it is a gift of God infuſed into us, and is an inherent quality, ſo faith in this ſenſe doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely juſtifie us, but relatively as it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends Chriſt with his benefits, and applyes them: ſo we are juſtified by faith alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out works, not for the inexiſtence, inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, dignity, or merit of faith, but for the inſtrumental efficiency, and application by it.</p>
                  <p>717. Joh. 6. 37. <hi>And him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Rom. 9. 16. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come to Chriſt, that is, to believe, is not in our power, but in the will of God, becauſe it is given from the Father, ſo that it is not in mans will, but in Gods
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:119711:127"/> mercy that we come to Chriſt, and believe in him.</p>
                  <p>718. Joh. 6. 53. <hi>Except you eat of the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his bloud, you have not life in you.</hi> Heb. 10. 1. <hi>The Fathers under the law had ſhadows of future good things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks of the ſpiritual receiving of his body and bloud by faith, as believers are made partakers of his benefits. In the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament under figures, in the New Tenament without figures; yet ſo, that the Fathers and we eat and drink the ſame ſpiritual meat and drink, and we as they receive Chriſt by faith.</p>
                  <p>719. Joh. 6. 54. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, hath eternal life.</hi> v. 63. <hi>The fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place is underſtood the fleſh of Chriſt which giveth life, in the latter the fleſh of men taken in a carnal ſenſe: alſo the fleſh profiteth nothing in that manner, as the <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naites</hi> dreamt concerning it.</p>
                  <p>720. Joh. 6. 54. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud hath eternall life.</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 28. <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh his own damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fleſh of Chriſt in it ſelf giveth life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is alwayes ſo, alſo in reſpect of men, becauſe ſome are faithful, which it doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally give life to, others Infidels who are not quickned in Chriſt; the cauſe whereof is not from Chriſt, but from their own Infidelity and unworthineſſe, for not diſcerning the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:119711:128"/> dy and bloud of the Lord, they draw on the judgements of God upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>721. Joh. 7. 5. <hi>Neither did his brethren believe in him.</hi> chap. 16. 27. <hi>Ye have believed that I came out from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The former place muſt be underſtood of his brethren and corporal kindred; the latter of the Apoſtles and his Diſciples, which were not all kindred to Chriſt according to the fleſh.</p>
                  <p>722. Joh. 7. 7. <hi>The world cannot hate you.</hi> chap. 15. 19. <hi>Ye are not of the world, but I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place Chriſt ſpeaketh to his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Couſins according to the fleſh that did not believe in him, living carnally, and after the manner of the world; in the latter place he ſpeaks of the Apoſtles who believed in him, and were purged from all dregs of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and he aſſigns the cauſes wherefore they and other believers were hated of the world.</p>
                  <p>723. Joh. 7. 8. <hi>I goe not not up yet unto this feaſt.</hi> verſ. 10. <hi>He went up to the feaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He went not openly with his friends that he might be ſeen, but privately; by this example of his, he hath taught us not to venture our ſelves raſhly amongſt our enemies.</p>
                  <p>724. Joh. 7. 16. <hi>My Doctrine is not mine, but my Fathers who ſent me.</hi> chap. 17. 10. <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Chriſt is ſaid to be his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his in different reſpects; the Father
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:119711:128"/> hath it from himſelf, Chriſt from his Father; alſo it is ſaid to be the Fathers, becauſe he ſent his Son, for Chriſt was ſent from the Father to publiſh it.</p>
                  <p>725. Joh. 7. 26. <hi>Doe the Rulers know indeed that this is the very Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 8. <hi>Had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The knowledge of Chriſt is either carnal and hiſtorical, ſo the Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Devils knew Chriſt; but this is nothing to ſalvation, or a ſpiritual knowledge by faith, which juſtifieth believers, and which the <hi>Jews</hi> that crucified Chriſt had not. Here the ſame thing is ſaid in both places, and what in the firſt place is explained by an Ironical Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in it ſelf negative, that in the latter place is done affirmatively.</p>
                  <p>726. Joh. 7. 34, 36. <hi>Where I am, thither ye cannot come.</hi> chap. 17. 24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo which thou haſt given me, be with me where I am.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt in the former place ſpeaks to the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and carnal men, rejecting his grace, and he ſaith to them, <hi>Where I am ye cannot come,</hi> that is, into heaven. In the latter place he ſpeaks of all the faithful which his Father hath given him.</p>
                  <p>727. Joh. 8. 16. <hi>I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me.</hi> chap. 16. 5. <hi>Now I goe my way to him that ſent me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place Chriſt ſpeaks of the unity
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:119711:129"/> of the Divine Nature, and the inſeparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Perſon; in the latter concerning his Death and Aſcenſion into Heaven, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede with God the Father for us.</p>
                  <p>728. Joh. 8. 23. <hi>Ye are of this world.</hi> chap. 15. 19. <hi>Ye are not of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be of the world is to be in darkneſſe, and to lead a wicked life, not to be of the world, is to acknowledge Chriſt, and to live godly. The firſt place therefore reſpects the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and carnal men, the latter reſpects all the faithful, the children of God, and elected to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>729. Joh. 8. 26. <hi>I have many things to ſay, and to judge of you.</hi> chap. 3. 18. <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place the preſent tenſe is put for <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 10.</note> the future, <hi>For we muſt all of us appear before Christs Tribunal, that every man may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10.</p>
                  <p>730. Joh. 8. 28. <hi>I doe nothing of myſelf.</hi> ch. 10. 18. <hi>I have power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt of himſelf, that is, without the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or againſt his Fathers authority did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p>731. Joh. 8. 33. <hi>We be Abrahams ſeed.</hi> v. 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſons carnal and ſons ſpiritual; the carnal <hi>Jews</hi> were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in reſpect of corporal propagation. Spiritual are ſuch as are guided by a good or evill ſpirit, ſons by
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:119711:129"/> a good Spirit are all the faithful who are of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by faith in Chriſt, who gave to believing <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he ſhould be called the Father of believers: Chriſt ſaith the <hi>Jews</hi> were from an evill ſpirit, who did not the works of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but of the Devil, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their malice and imitation; and he that doth the works of another may be called his ſon.</p>
                  <p>732. Joh. 8. 35. <hi>The ſervant abideth not in the houſe for ever.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 17. <hi>We ſhall ever be with the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place is ſpoken of a ſervant of ſin, in the latter of the faithful; who ſhall be delivered from all bondage being made free by the Son, Joh. 8. 36.</p>
                  <p>733. Joh. 8. 36. <hi>Yee ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Rom. 7. 23. <hi>Paul was a captive under the law of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The faithful are free from ſin, in reſpect of condemnation, dominion, and perfect liberty which they ſhall enjoy in the next life, they are ſaid to be captive under ſin, by reaſon of inherent ſin; which begets ill deſires in them againſt their wills.</p>
                  <p>734. Joh. 8. 46. <hi>Which of you convinceth me of ſin.</hi> chap. 9. 24. <hi>We know that this man is a ſinner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks of firm proof, that no man could convince him of ſin. The <hi>Jews</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight and calumny ſaid falſely, that he was a ſinner.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:119711:130"/>

                  </p>
                  <p>Hee meanes glory acquired from his Father, not affected glory: and he calls himſelf, <hi>the Light of the world,</hi> truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing what he is, and not by hunting after vain glory.</p>
                  <p>736. Joh. 8. 51. <hi>If a man keep my ſaying, he ſhall never ſee death.</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed unto all men once to dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks of ſpiritual and eternal death, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of corporal and temporal death.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are three kind of ſpeeches concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt, ſome things are ſpoken of him according to his divine Nature, ſo he was before <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſome things are ſpoken according to his humane Nature, when he is called <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, or <hi>Davids,</hi> and ſome things are ſpoken of both Natures, that he is the Mediator between God and Man, 1 Tim. 2. 5.</p>
                  <p>738. Joh. 9. 3. <hi>Neither this Man ſinned nor his Parents.</hi> Rom. 3. 10. <hi>There is none righteous, no not one, none that underſtandeth.</hi>

                  <p>The cauſe of his blindeneſſe was no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and enormous wikedneſſe of himſelf or his parents, though all men be ſinners, and for their ſins, infirmities and defects of nature

                  <p>In the former place by Judgement is meant a benefit given to men by the coming of Chriſt, by which he brought thoſe things to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that were out of order; in the latter Chriſt ſpeaks of his principal end of his coming into the world.</p>

                  <p>In the former place Chriſt ſpeaks not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively, becauſe the works of the Trinity outwardly are common to the three Perſons: there is no work of the Son which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth not work in him. In the latter he aſcribing operation to the Father, he aſſerts that it is done by the authority and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of his Father, ſo ſpeaking of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order of working, he takes not away the unity of eſſence, Majeſty and power.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Death is temporal and eternal, temporal in this world is corporal and ſpiritual; Chriſt ſpeaks of both in the former place; Spiritual death is either of them, who being dead, have not Chriſts quickning Spirit, and of this he ſpeaks not here; but of them that being quickned by Chriſts Spirit are dead to ſin and the fleſh; in the latter is meant chiefly eternal death.</p>
                  <p>747. Joh. 11. 26. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in me ſhall never dye.</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It is appointed for all men once to dye.</hi>

                  <p>Juſtice doth not oppoſe the goodneſſe of God puniſhing wicked men as they are wicked, but goodneſſe invites men to repentance, deferring the puniſhments of the wicked, not as they are wicked, but as they are Gods creatures, and he delights not in their deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle commemorates the diſſolute life of the Heathens, to make us avoid it, not to imitate it; by diſgracing it, that ſo being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with that filthineſſe, we may eſcape the anger of God.</p>

                  <p>In the former place is treated of the effect of faith that goes before retribution, in the later of a neceſſary inſtrument.

                  <p>Juſtification is attributed to the Law and to Works, not ſimply, but by ſuppoſition, if any man can perfectly fulfill the works of the Law; but no man can in this weakneſſe perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Law.</p>

                  <p>Externall circumciſion in the Old Teſtament was a Sacrament, upon condition of the Law fulfilled: Under the New Teſtament, as other Ceremonies, it is mortall; in the place of this came Baptiſm: in former times it did profit the Fathers, as a ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith: after Chriſt came, and the Goſpel was planted it was taken away, by the full plenty of ſpirituall Circumciſion.</p>

                  <p>The guilt of <hi>Adam</hi> is here compared with the grace of Chriſt, becauſe both have that deſcends on their followers. <hi>Adam</hi> derives his guilt on all men by nature, Chriſt derives his righteouſneſſe by grace on all that beleeve on him.</p>

                  <p>The firſt place is concerning thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called are obedient to the holy Ghoſt, and make their vocation firm unto the end of their lives: The later is of thoſe who reſiſt the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God; in reſpect of the former there are as many predeſtinated as are called, but of the later more called then are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The wiſh of <hi>Paul</hi> was conditionall, if it were lawfull and might be done; the Apoſtle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſheweth the vehemency of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his kindred, and ſubmits himſelf to the Divine will. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> on this place ſaith, that <hi>Paul</hi> by a premeditated prayer deſired to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Chriſt by a temporall and eternall abjection for the ſalvation of his brethren, and ſo would by his own deſtruction redeem them to eternall ſalvation; neither did he therefore love his brethren more then Chriſt, for he did not deſire to be ſeparated from the love of Chriſt, but from the fruit of his love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:119711:150"/> he deſireth to periſh not as an enemy of Chriſt, but a preſerver of his brethren, as Chriſt was made a curſe for us, not as Gods enemy, but as our Redeemer.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is concerning the moſt free will and power of God, who may have mercy on whom he pleaſe; his antecedent will reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to all men, his conſequent will is reſtrained to the beleevers and unbeleevers, and ſo he will have merey of the faithfull, that they may be ſaved, but he juſtly puniſheth and hardneth the unbeleevers and wicked men who reſiſt his grace freely offered unto them.</p>
                  <p>868. Rom. 10. 10. <hi>With the mouth is made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion unto ſalvation.</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 20. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not in word.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>God rejected the Jews by his juſt judgement, not that were guiltleſſe, but becauſe they were rebellious and unbeleeving, and ſo cauſed God to caſt them off, and to take the Gentiles in their room: the later place is to be underſtood of the evil of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>871. Rom. 11. 22. <hi>The Jews that were cut off ſhall be engrafted again, and the Gentiles ſhall be cut off</hi> Ch. 11. 29, 15. <hi>The gifts and callings of God are without repentance.</hi>

                  <p>The unbeleeving Jews are excluded, but they that beleeve ſhall be grafted in again and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore here follows no change of the counſell of God.</p>
                  <p>872. Rom. 11. 16. <hi>If the firſt fruits be holy, the lump is alſo holy, and if the root be holy, ſo are the branches.</hi> Mat. 12. 39. <hi>An evil and adulterous generation.</hi> John 8. 44. <hi>The Jews were of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the devil.</hi>

                  <p> The Jews are called holy by right of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, becauſe they were ſeparated from the prophane Gentiles, thence it is concluded that all hope of ſalvation is not cut off from them; they are called a perverſe generation for their wicked works.</p>
                  <p>873. Rom. 11. 17. <hi>The Gentiles were engraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the ſtock of the Jews, or the Olive tree.</hi> Ch. 6. 5. <hi>If we be planted into the likeneſſe of his death, we ſhall be alſo into the likeneſſe of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is the Vine, the Olive tree, the Figg tree in reſpect of his efficacy, which is imputed to the Church by participation; and they that are engrafted into Chriſt the Head, are made members of the Church which is his Body.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place concerns hypocrites, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Doctrine of the Church; the faithfull who are certain of their ſalvation by confidence from the heart, fear with a filiall, but not a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear, for they are taught by that fear to be carefull that they do not by carnall ſecurity caſt themſelves into Gods diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>875. Rom. 11. 25. <hi>Blindneſſe is happened in part unto Iſrael, untill the fulneſſe of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 16. <hi>The wrath of God is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi>

                  <p> The wrath of God remains upon the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, obſtinate, malicious Jews, who cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Chriſt, perſecuted the Apoſtles, and hindred the preaching of the Goſpel to the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>876. Rom. 11. 26. <hi>And all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Luk. 18. 8. <hi>When the ſonne of man cometh, ſhall he finde faith on the earth?</hi>

                  <p>Chriſt ſpeaks comparatively, extenuating the number of the faithfull in the laſt times, either in reſpect of the multitude of the wicked, or ſeduction of Antichriſt; but Antichriſt being diſcovered and conſumed with the blaſt of Gods mouth, there will be a great multitude of the faithfull, ſo that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be ſaved; for as the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is not taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally for the converſion of every individuall amongſt the Gentiles, but for a great part, ſo it muſt be underſtood of the converſion of the Jews.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>The firſt place is concerning the inſcrutable ſecrets of Gods wiſdom, which are not needfull for us to know; the later is concerning myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:119711:152"/> that belong to our ſalvation, revealed in Gods Word, and ſuch which no man by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reaſon, were it never ſo acute, could ever come to know.</p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle underſtands here by coals the ſpirituall things of conſcience, not naturall coals, for benefits done to an enemy are a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to his conſcience, which pricks and burns our adverſary, doth juſtly convince him, and ſtirres him up to peace, concord, amendment of life; let us therefore overcome evil with good, and ſo win the victory over our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>

                  <p>The Decrees of the Magiſtrate, if they agree with Gods Word, and are appointed for good order, they binde the conſcience: ſo alſo Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall conſtitutions, for keeping the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Laws, are to be piouſly obſerved, ſo farre as they hinder not the uſe of our Chriſtian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The love of our neighbour proceeding from the love of God, is the fulfilling of the Law; ſince we have but the Image of God in our neighbour, therefore God muſt be principally beloved.</p>

                  <p>Emulation joyned with envy by reaſon of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers profit, is evil, and meant by the firſt place; in the later, ſincerity of love proceeding from good zeal and Juſticee.</p>

                  <p>They are weak who know not the true uſe of indifferent things. <hi>Peter</hi> being taught by the heavenly viſion, that diſtinction of meats was taken away, deſerved to be reprehended; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what he learned of God, and taught in the publike counſell, he yet obſerved not, but was ſcandalous both to Jews and Gentiles.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place he avoids the judgement of dignity, of preferring himſelf before others: in the later he commends the judgement of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and proving of our ſelves, which belongs to all men.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in the former place appeals from the corrupt judgement of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto Chriſt the ſupream Judge; as if he ſhould ſay, Do not paſſe your cenſure before you know the matter perfectly, and the parties have been heard, or before the laſt judgement day, when God ſhall judge us all; by which words he caſts a bridle on all perverſe cenſurers, and condemns untimely judgement before things be certainly known.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſheweth that this wickedneſſe was deteſted by the more honeſt heathens, that without deteſtation it could not be named before chaſt ears, alſo the offenders themſelves did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt that wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>912. 1 Cor. 5. 12. <hi>What have I to do to judge them that are without?</hi> ch. 6. 2. <hi>Do you not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is of his Apoſtolicall function, whereby <hi>Paul</hi> was very carefull of thoſe who
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:119711:157"/> were made members of the Church by the word he preached to them: the later is of the Saints in generall, and their judgement of approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Saints, ſaith <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſhall judge the world by their exemplary judgement, becauſe by their example the perfidiouſneſs of the world ſhall be condemned.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place the Apoſtle condemne their deſire to contend before an unbeleeving Judge; yet he doth not forbid them to appear before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Judicature.</p>
                  <p>914. 1 Cor. 6. 5. <hi>Is there not a wiſe man among you?</hi> ch. 1. 20. <hi>There are not many wiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place he makes the queſtion, in the next he aſſerts that there are not many wiſe men amongſt the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> but he requires not carnall wiſdom, but Chriſtian wiſdom, the beginning whereof is the fear of the Lord.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is of the abuſe of the belly, of the fleſh and worldly pleaſures; the belly, being it is a part of mans body, ſhall not be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but glorified with the other members.</p>
                  <p>916. 1 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</hi> ver. 2. <hi>Let every man have his own wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Good</hi> here is not oppoſed to evil, or to ſinne, as if it were ſinne to live in Wedlock; but it
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:119711:158"/> ſignifies tranquillity of life, eſpecially in time of perſecution: The wife before the fall was given to man by God, as a helper to his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſociety, generation, education, oeconomy; and much more after the fall is ſhe a helper to him in his infirmity, and is the remedy of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place leaves it free to married peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 24. Mat 19. 6.</note> to live continently if they can, and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſo to do: In the later places, the pious cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of married people by the Inſtitution of God and the approbation of Chriſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>

                  <p>Firſt he ſaith, <hi>not I, but the Lord,</hi> becauſe it was a Law to forbid divorcements: afterward, <hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not the Lord,</hi> becauſe by him without a commandment of God the holy Ghoſt did then teach.</p>
                  <p>919. 1 Cor. 7. 14. <hi>Your children are holy.</hi> Epheſ. 2. 3. <hi>We were the children of wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place ſheweth the honeſt procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian children, who though they are by nature the children of wrath, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Covenant and faith they are called holy.</p>
                  <p>920. 1 Cor. 7. 21. <hi>Art thou called being a ſervant? care not for it.</hi> ver. 21. <hi>but if thou</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is to comfort ſervants againſt the troubles of ſervitude, and he will not have them for that condition to forſake the faith of Chriſt whereunto they were called, and loſe their Chriſtian liberty for their corporall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: So that the inſtruction added to it makes no diſagreement, becauſe ſervants ought with a willing minde to embrace lawfull freedom, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by reaſon and a ſafe conſcience.</p>
                  <p>921. 1 Cor. 7. 23. <hi>Be not ſervants of men.</hi> ch. 9. 19. <hi>The Apoſtle makes himſelf a ſervant to all men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is indeed a moſt ignominious ſlavery and ſad ſervice to depend on the commands of other men, beſides the commandments of God, but to be ſerviceable for the ſacred Miniſtry is not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious but honourable.</p>
                  <p>922. 1 Cor. 7. 23. <hi>Be not ſervants of men.</hi> Eph. 6. 5. <hi>Servants obey your Maſters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Service is ſpirituall or carnall, from that he diſſwades in the former place, for we muſt not <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1. Eph. 6. 6.</note> obey the wicked deſires of men, and diſhoneſt commands, but muſt ſo ſerve them, that we may not offend God or wrong our conſciences; this he chargeth us to do, which though it may be thought hard, yet whilſt we do it in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our hearts, for that God requires it, it will be accepted.</p>
                  <p>923. 1 Cor. 7. 25. <hi>Concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give my judgement.</hi> Matth. 19. 12. <hi>There are ſome Eunuchs which have made themſelves Eunuchs</hi>
                     <pb n="304" facs="tcp:119711:159"/> 
                     <hi>for the Kingdom of heavens ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no command of Virginity in both the Covenants. Chriſt ſpeaks of the Eſſens of the time paſt; condemning them of raſhneſſe, becauſe they ſought for the Kingdom of God in perpetuall continency, which is a ſingular gift of God, and given to very few. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks for neceſſity, ſetting down what is expedient for all, by reaſon of time and place, becauſe it was not ſafe for Chriſtians, becauſe of perſecutions, to ſtay alwaies in one place, and becauſe of the cares which ordinarily follow married people.</p>
                  <p>624. 1 Cor. 7. 29. <hi>Let thoſe that have wives be as though they had none.</hi> ver. 3, 4, 5. <hi>He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves conjugall cuſtom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place he forbids not the uſe of Marriage, but he would not have the husband too uxorious, and he bids them to uſe the goods of this world moderately, leaſt we ſhould be overcome with evils, or ſuppoſe the good of this life to be perpetuall: ſince if we loſe not all here by ſome accidents, yet in our doubts we muſt leave them all.</p>
                  <p>925. 1 Cor. 7. 32. <hi>I would have you to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carefulneſſe.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 10. <hi>He that will not labour, let him not eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By carefulneſſe here he means not, to call men from their vocations and houſhold cares, but the inconveniences of Matrimony, whereby we are often called from the ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>926. 1 Corinth. 8. 1. <hi>Knowledge puffeth up.</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 5. <hi>Enriched in Chriſt with all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>

                  <p> The firſt place condemns vain knowledge adjoyned with pride; Knowledge puffeth up, nor of it ſelf, but by accident, ſmatterers and boaſters abuſing it, neglecting what is for their edification: the later praiſeth knowledge joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with charity, as it was a gift of God in Chriſt amongſt the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Infirm Chriſtians may periſh, by reaſon of their infirmity, Satans malice, and the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deney of the wicked, who abuſing their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty, are an offence to the faithfull, they cannot periſh in reſpect of the counſell of God and the merits of Chriſt, and the efficacy of his interceſſion, who by a mighty hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>928. 1 Cor. 9. 15. <hi>It were better for me to dye then that any man ſhould make my glorying void.</hi> ch. 1. 29. <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is of true and honeſt glory, neceſſary for a good conſcience that hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſcharged it ſelf in its office: the later is concerning vain, unjuſt boaſting, and unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which muſt be avoided.</p>
                  <p>929. 1 Cor. 9. 20. <hi>To the Jews I became as a Jew.</hi> Acts 13. 46. <hi>We turn to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle would have won both Jews and Gentiles unto Chriſt; for the Jews cauſe he
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:119711:160"/> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> ſhore his head, paid his vow in the Temple, and obſerved other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies for a time: in the later place he turns to the Gentiles, from the Jews who were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and thruſt away from them the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>930. 1 Cor. 9. 22. <hi>I am made all things to all men.</hi> Gal. 1. 10. <hi>If I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place as a wiſe Teacher he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates himſelf to ſtrong and weak, to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie them in the Goſpel, not as flatterers and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites do.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt place is of thoſe that are juſtified, and heirs of eternall life, that fight a good fight: the later is concerning the efficient cauſe of our ſalvation, which is the grace and mercy of God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>To be baptized in the name is taken impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> that is in the Doctrine and Law delivered by him, or by his Miniſtry, as <hi>Acts</hi> 19. into <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine; but in the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is taken properly, ſo we are baptized in the name of the Father, Sonne and holy Ghoſt, for baptiſm cannot be performed in the name of any creature, becauſe to be baptized in the
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:119711:160"/> name of any one, that is by his command and authority to be baptized for his worſhip, faith and obedience.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Temptation is the divine probation of our faith and obedience, or a deviliſh tempting of us to ſinne, or when men tempt us to perſevere in ſinne, or when the weakneſſe of our nature draws us into faults and errours, ſuch were the temptations of the Saints, and of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> here.</p>

                  <p>The firſt is to be underſtood with limitation, that no man out of over-much love of himſelf ſhould do his own occaſions boaſtingly, which is farre from Chriſtian charity, which teacheth that a man is not born for himſelf, but to ſerve God, and to do good to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

                  <p> Faith is a work, but not ours, or proceeding <note place="margin">Joh. 6. 29.</note> from our own ſtrength, for then it would not juſtifie us, but it is the work of God, and a quality in us reſpecting the merits of Chriſt, therefore the Apoſtle cals not faith it ſelf ſo much a work, as he doth that which proceeds from faith.</p>

                  <p>All thoſe are Antichriſts in generall, who deny Chriſts Divine or humane Nature, or in his Perſon or Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In ſpeciall, that great Antichriſt is the ſonne of Perdition, who in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> was not yet revealed, though the myſtery of iniquity began to work.</p>
                  <p>1028. 2 Joh. v. 10. <hi>If there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſes, neither bid him God ſpeed.</hi> Mat. 5. 44. <hi>Love your enemies.</hi>

                  <p> The firſt place forbids not to ſhew our duty of humanity to all men, or to ſalute them civilly, but we are admoniſhed not to uſe too great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with ſeducers.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the former place it is not ſaid, as though the Apoſtle would ſay ſomething elſe, then what is contained in the ſacred Scriptures: In the later, he manifeſtly confirms that all things are written which appertain and are neceſſary to true ſaith in Chriſt, and to eternall life. So that we have no need of Traditions by word of mouth.</p>

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:119711:178"/> knowledge of all things communicated to him.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The bodily death is one, becauſe the ſoul is but once ſeparated from the body: The ſecond death is taken Metaphorically, for the miſery and torment of the ſoul after the death of the body.</p>

                  <p>The cry of the ſouls proceeds not from a wicked deſire of revenge, but an earneſt deſire for Gods glory, becauſe they would have no ungodlineſſe or wickedneſſe remain unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the day of revenge and judgement; we ſuffering here according to Chriſts command pray for our enemies.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Church compared with the numerous multitude of the wicked, is a little flock; but conſidered in it ſelf, it comprehends an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable multitude of all Ages, Sexes, Places, Tribes and people.</p>

                  <p>In the former place the Temple is taken fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively, this the holy Ghoſt intimates, that God is worſhipped moſt holily with Hymns and Pſalms; in the later place, we muſt not think there ſhall be any materiall Temple in the life to come, as we have here on earth.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:119711:180"/> of the world, not properly, but figuratively, and in Gods Decree, by Types, Predictions, and efficacy, by acceptation, not by execution.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place the earth is taken in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſignification, becauſe the effects of all the Vials redounds to the earth in a manner, and to earthly men the followers of Antichriſt, for whatſoever the wrath of God was which was caſt on the Seas, Rivers, or the Ayr, or Sunne, was not for themſelves, but to afflict the earth and thoſe that dwell thereon.</p>

                  <p>The firſt place is a ſpeciall command of God concerning retaliation: In the later Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids raſh judgement concerning others, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Law of retaliation the more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Jews.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the firſt place a certain number is put for an uncertain, and he ſpeaks of the ſtate of the Church, which during the reign of Antichriſt ſeemed to be dead; but afterwards at the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, ſhe roſe again, which is the firſt reſurrection.</p>

                  <p>The Morall Law forbids private men to do hurt with an evil affection, but to hurt another man at Gods command, is not againſt the Law, becauſe God will have it ſo, and he commands us to puniſh malefactors; good men are proved by injuſtice, and ſo are crowned with Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by it; in the former place is ſpoken of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment juſtly inflicted on the wicked, which is not againſt charity, ſince God doth moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of all the creatures to puniſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men.</p>
